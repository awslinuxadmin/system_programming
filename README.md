Linux systems programming in c 
My git repo for c systems programming, rust, and kernel programming. I am dedicated to learning these fields and hope to work as a kernel dev or engineer.
I have been using UNIX, Linux since the 80's on my first Mac Plus. I have recently got the bug again and love C and am becoming fond of Rust. Even have a t-shirt. I am diligently working to add to my Linux skills and hope to master the kernel

My first attempt at creating an operating system, BakerOS is in the BakerOS directory. It will be a multi-threaded kernel OS.
